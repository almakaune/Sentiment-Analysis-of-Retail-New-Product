TNA,Sweatshirts,"I'm such a sucker for a good basic and this is one of them. I saw my co-worker wearing this top in the black color with high-waisted trousers and wow did she look cute. The top just looked comfortable and fitted but in a comfortable way. I ended up ordering the black myself and I loved it. It looked really short when I got in the mail but after I put it on it wasn't so bad. I truly recommend that every one size up a size as it does run a little smaller. I just ordered the grey and taupe color so I'll have three colors to play with. I wear this top with sweats, or high-waisted jeans or trousers or skirts!",5,So worth it!

I'm probably a size s but I went with a m because I dont like like hoodies too fitted. This fit is more of a standard ""narrow"" fit rather than their other oversized styles. The light fabric is still soft and keeps me warm enough, but drapes nice."
TNA,Sweatshirts,The Perfect Light Hoodie,4,Cute but overpriced for the quality. I wish I had sized up just to get an oversized fit like the other TNA hoodies I have. This also isn't super soft and is more of a light weight pullover.

Babaton,Pants,Jotham,4,Super stretchy fabric! Does run a bit smaller so definitely size down
Babaton,Pants,Jotham,4,"Great fabric but long! I'm 5'4"" with an average build in that my legs and torso are fairly proportionate, with my torso perhaps even being slightly shorter, proportionally. While I love the fabric of these pants and generally find them to be very flattering and cute, I want to warn people that the leg is very long. When I stand without shoes the pant legs hit the floor. If I wear shoes that are maybe at least 3/4"", the pants will drape and it looks kind of cool depending on the outfit, though the slits dont fall the same way on me. Nonetheless, they are still great pants and I love them. Was disappointing that they won't look the same way--would be really nice if Aritzia came out with a petite version of these!"

Wilfred Free,T Shirts,Weekend,3,Not my favorite but I might have gotten the wrong size. I got a medium since the model is quite small and is wearing a small.

Babaton,Pants,Dexter,5,"I'm 5/4 with an hourglass figurer, and I weigh about 155 lbs. The L fits me just right, I have ordered them in an XL when they have gone on sale but needed to take the waist in. Overall I'd say the fit is right, the length sits just above my ankle bone and looks cute with loafers, heels, or sneakers. These are very versatile I feel like I can dress them up for dinner or wear them on my weekend walks."
Babaton,Pants,Dexter,5,"This is a really great comfortable pant, I have several pairs and I never get tired of them."
Babaton,Pants,Dexter,5,Typically a size small in pants but sized down and went for an XS — it fit perfectly. Got the black for work and it’s pretty low maintenance — no ironing needed post-wash with very little wrinkling. Instructions say dry clean only but gentle handwash and line dry work just fine for me in the past year or so.

Babaton,Pants,Lincoln,2,"I was expecting a longer pair of pants since the models are 5'9 and the pants are long on them- I'm 5'4 and these barely hit my feet. In fact, they look cropped if I put them on my waist. I would have to wear them lower for them to sit properly. I would also suggest getting your normal size, I took the advice in the reviews and ordered a size up and they're way too big. Sadly I can't return them at the sale price otherwise I would have. They don't look lengthening and are certainly not worth the price if there is no consistency in the products. Another let down from Aritizia- overpriced HM quality items."

Babaton,T Shirts,Gonzalo,5,I want all in every colour. I swear it is so soft. 10/10
Babaton,T Shirts,Gonzalo,4,"Fit a bit tight, I have three different colours, they are perfect with highwaisted jeans or skirts! Very classic piece."
Babaton,T Shirts,Gonzalo,5,"I've always been a medium at Aritzia, but based on these reviews I ordered a large. I'm SO GLAD that I did. I think a medium would have been too form fitting, and made it less appropriate for work. The large is still fitted but loose enough that it's super comfortable. It's long enough that my belly button isn't showing, but short enough that I can wear it with high waisted pants and not have it be hanging over the top"
Babaton,T Shirts,Gonzalo,3,"ordered it first in stone taupe size XS and loved it! Fabric is thin so its light and airy. I am a size 24"" waist and usually order XS here, but found this to run a little small. It was shorter on me than on the models and showed some skin when wearing high waisted bottoms. I found myself wearing this any chance I got so I decided to order it one size (S) up in the yellow. It was so much bigger on me!! the size XS was super fitted so I was very surprised to find that the S was so loose. Also in the yellow, the fabric is really see-through and it honestly looks cheap. would recommend you get your regular size for a more cropped top and only in the darker colors. not worth the price for a cheap looking thin shirt in lighter colors."

Babaton,T Shirts,Gonzalo,5,"I love this top! I am 5'1"" 105 lb and 32DD. I am usually an XS in Babaton tops and ordered an XS. It is absolutely perfect. The fabric is a soft ribbed, stretchy material that is fitted but not skin tight and drapes beautifully. It hits right at the waist so it's not super cropped like a lot of Aritzia tops. I ordered it in the color Scarab (dark green) and it looks perfect with my golden/tan skin tone. Could see this being dressed up with jeans and heels or a midi skirt, or dressed down with a pair of joggers that I have in the same color. Highly recommend!!!"

Wilfred,Dresses,Fantasy,5,"This is a fashion dress in that it looks a little costume-y and it's not flattering in a traditional sense. I am 5'2"" 104lbs and although it's not big (it is pretty fitted on shoulders and chest), it looks a bit like I'm drowning in it. For my height, I wish it was a touch shorter but what's new. Also the fabric is really fun and feels nice but it is naturally crinkly and full. I love it and received many compliments on it when i went to social distance street drinks!"
Wilfred,Dresses,Fantasy,1,I wanted to love this dress but it was unfortunately ugly. The fabric is weird and stiff and just was absolutely hideous on me.
Wilfred,Dresses,Fantasy,4,"amazing fabric, cut and construction. Needed to exchange for smaller size though"
Wilfred,Dresses,Fantasy,4,It's a beautiful dress but I wish it was made from a different material. It gets wrinkled very easily and is slightly see through.
Wilfred,Dresses,Fantasy,5,Like the valentino dress thats $3350

Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,5,Very cute and comfy!

Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,5,The jacket fits comfortably. Can layer it over something as well if you like. Comfort is the key word here.
Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,4,Love this jacket. Super light weight and looks sleek. The fit is definitely bigger so I would recommend sizing down. Great Jacket for traveling!
Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,4,"Love the length and fit, and style so much. Just don’t like the sleeve length. Too short"
Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,3,It’s a cute jacket but the double zipper is tricky and gets stuck a lot. The interior drawstrings to cinch around the waste don’t stay tight.
Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,4,It is a little bigger than I would have liked but still a good raincoat.
Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,5,This rain jacket is exactly what I was looking for. Love the shape and fit!
Babaton,Jackets and Coats,Raindrop,5,Super cute jacket for spring time.Go for a size smaller cause it fits bulky.Getting compliments non stop.Love Love Love

Wilfred,Pants,Anthem,5,"I was nervous that this runs small but it does not! I ordered my normal size and it fit perfect plus my waist still has room which will be great for tucking in shirts. My waist is much smaller than my hips and thighs but everything felt good in these pants, which isn't usually the case for all Wilfred pants. Unfortunately, I thought they would be longer because they look full length on the model and I am much shorter. I also own the Pearl Grey Cherrelle and its a perfect pair."
Wilfred,Pants,Anthem,5,"Love this pant, love the grey, great fit. Soft, airy, breathable and comfortable material."
Wilfred,Pants,Anthem,5,Perfect fitting pants! They fit my waist perfectly and are an amazing length. Would look great with some strappy sandals or some cute sneakers!

Babaton,Blouses,Murphy Long,5,"I am impressed by the quality of this sleeveless blouse :) I love how the blouse is flowy and had a nice the v neck cut. It is also not see through and it is lined, which is a must for me! I highly recommend it."
Babaton,Blouses,Murphy Long,5,"Please keep making this in more colours (I vote for Fresco Pink); the crop Murphy looks ridiculous on me, but this version is a very flattering length that lands about 1-1.5 inches above where my legs meet. For reference, I'm a muscular hourglass, 5'5"" 37-27-38 and I thought the Small was perfect, but if my hips were any larger the Small would be too tight at the hips. For those who are sick of crop tops."
Babaton,Blouses,Murphy Long,5,Fits perfectly. Love the layers. I would love to see more colours!

Wilfred,Skirts,Fantasy,3,This skirt is very cute but definitely “pouffy”. The material is light though. I’m 5”4 and the skirt fits calf length.
Wilfred,Skirts,Fantasy,5,"i live for this fabric -- it's super casual yet has a sheen to it, so it has a a boho-sheik feel. perfect with heels (it's a longer midi than I prefer as someone 5'7"") but when it pull it up i can wear with a crop top and heels and feel like a 50s movie star. makes me feel super feminine on dates given how the fabric moves."
Wilfred,Skirts,Fantasy,5,Love it! Love the cut and style. The fabric drapes beautifully.
Wilfred,Skirts,Fantasy,1,"The fabric is is impossible to iron or steam and when you wear it, it is wrinkly all over, which looks terrible."
